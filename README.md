# INFO
## Blockchain
The Vikascoin blockchain is capable of handling higher transaction volume than its counterpart -
Bitcoin. Due to more frequent block generation, the network supports
more transactions without a need to modify the software in the future.
As a result, merchants get faster confirmation times,
while still having ability to wait for more confirmations when selling bigger ticket items.

## MINING
Miners are currently awarded with 150 new vikascoins per block,
an amount which gets halved roughly every 3 years (every 788,400 blocks).
The Vikascoin network is therefore scheduled to produce 10 billion Vikascoins

## OPEN SOURCE
Litecoin is an open source software project released under the MIT/X11 license
which gives you the power to run, modify, and copy the software and to distribute,
at your option, modified copies of the software.
The software is released in a transparent process that allows for independent
verification of binaries and their corresponding source code.
